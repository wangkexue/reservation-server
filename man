.SH NAME
.B Airline Reservation System
.SH DESCRIPTION
.B We implement the priority scheduling for the extra points.
.SH DESIGN APPROACH
.B For priority scheduling, we define a flag named PRIORITY_QUEUE in thread_pool.h. We create a number of threads at process startup and place them into a thread pool, where they sit and wait for work. When the server receives a request, it calls a thread from this pool to execute the request, if anyone is available. Once the thread completes its work, it returns to the pool and waits for next work. If the pool contains no available thread, the work will be put in the end of work-queue, until one becomes free. We use a cirular array implementation for normal worker queue and a singly linked list for priority queue to implement our worker queue and store requests. To deal with the race condition, we use mutual exclusion in seats.c. We lock the seats when user want to read or make change of the state of seats, and unlock them after that.
